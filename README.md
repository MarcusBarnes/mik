# MIK, the Move to Islandora Kit.

## Overview

The Move to Islandora Kit (MIK) converts source content files and accompanying metadata into ingest packages used by existing Islandora batch ingest modules, [Islandora Batch](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_batch), [Islandora Newspaper Batch](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_newspaper_batch), and [Islandora Book Batch](https://github.com/Islandora/islandora_book_batch). In other words, it doesnâ€™t import objects into Islandora, it prepares content for importing into Islandora.

MIK is designed to be extensible. The base classes that convert from the source metadata to XML files for importing into Islandora, and that convert the source content files into the required directory structure for importing, can be subclassed easily. We'll be documenting how to do this in the near future.

MIK is developed by staff at Simon Fraser University Library in support of their migration from CONTENTdm to Islandora, but its longer-term purpose is as a general toolkit for preparing content for importing content into Islandora.

Additional information is available on the MIK [wiki](https://github.com/MarcusBarnes/mik/wiki).

## Requirements

PHP 5.5.0 or higher.

## Installation

### Linux/OS X

1. Clone this git repo.
2. Change into the resulting directory and install Composer by running the following command: ```curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php```
3. Run the following command: ```php composer.phar install```

### Windows
1. Install PHP and ensure that you can run `php -v` from a command prompt (you will need to adjust your PATH so it can find php.exe).
2. Make sure the required extensions are enabled by adding these lines to your php.ini:

  ```
  extension_dir = "ext"
  extension=php_openssl.dll
  extension=php_mbstring.dll
  ```
3. Clone this git repo (or download the zip if you don't have git).
4. Install composer using "Composer-Setup.exe" linked from the [Composer website](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md).
5. In the mik directory, run `composer install`

## Usage

Configure your conversion job by creating an .ini file, and then run:

```mik --config=foo.ini```

On Windows, you'll need to run:

```php mik --config=foo.ini```

The `--config` option is required, but you can also add a `--limit` option if you only want to create a specific number of import packages. This option is useful for testing. For example:

```mik --config=foo.ini --limit=10```

## Current status

So far, we have "toolchains" (complete sets of MIK code) to for converting CONTENTdm newspapers and multi-file PDFs into Islandora import packages. We also have a toolchain for creating import packages from CSV metadata files and content files on a local filesystem. We are now focusing on CONTENTdm-to-single-file Islandora objects, then after that, CONTENTdm books objects.

## Development

See README_DEV.md for coding standards, etc.

## Troubleshooting and support
